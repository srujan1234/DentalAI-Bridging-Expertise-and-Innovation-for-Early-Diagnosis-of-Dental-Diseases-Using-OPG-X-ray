**Project Journey Update**
---------------------------
**DATE: 24-10-23**
As of today, I'm thrilled to share the exciting news we've made in our project journey. Our image collection initiative is well underway, and we've successfully gathered 117 Orthopantomography (OPG) X-ray images from various clinics. Our goal is ambitious to reach beyond 5000 images, capturing a comprehensive range of dental scenarios. 
**Next:** Annotations and Model Training Looking ahead, our focus remains branched. We're committed to expanding our image library, capturing the details of diverse dental conditions. Concurrently, we're moving up for the next phase, taking our annotated dataset to train and refine our YOLOv3 model.
